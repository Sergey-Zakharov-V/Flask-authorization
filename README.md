# Flask-authorization
By implementing authentication in Flask, I have learned a lot of valuable skills. First and foremost, I mastered working with the Flask framework and its extension Flask-Login, which provides convenient tools for user authentication.

Based on the concept of sessions in Flask, I learned how to create and manage user sessions to ensure secure and reliable authentication. I explored the use of access tokens and cookies to store session information.

Furthermore, I learned methods to check user authentication in various parts of the application. I implemented mechanisms to protect routes and controllers, restricting access to specific functions and pages only for authenticated users.

Overall, implementing authentication in Flask has provided me with valuable experience in web development and security. I have gained practical skills in creating authentication systems, working with databases, and securing web application routes.
